# Research: JWT Authentication and Authorization System

**Feature**: JWT Authentication and Authorization System  
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Branch**: 001-jwt-auth-system

## Research Tasks Completed

### JWT Implementation for Go/Gin Applications

**Decision**: Use golang-jwt/jwt/v4 library for JWT token generation and validation  
**Rationale**:

- Most popular and well-maintained JWT library for Go (1.7k+ stars)
- Supports all standard JWT claims and custom claims
- Built-in validation for expiration, issuer, audience
- Compatible with Gin middleware patterns
- Minimal dependencies and good performance

**Alternatives considered**:

- dgrijalva/jwt-go (deprecated, security issues)
- lestrrat-go/jwx (more complex, overkill for basic auth)
- Manual JWT implementation (too risky, not recommended)

**Implementation approach**:

- Use HS256 algorithm with secret key from environment
- Include user ID, roles, and expiration in token claims
- Implement middleware for automatic token validation

### Secure Cookie Configuration for JWT Storage

**Decision**: Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies with appropriate expiration  
**Rationale**:

- httpOnly prevents XSS attacks by blocking JavaScript access
- secure flag ensures cookies only sent over HTTPS
- sameSite=strict prevents CSRF attacks
- Short expiration (1-24 hours) with refresh token pattern

**Alternatives considered**:

- localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
- sessionStorage (lost on tab close)
- In-memory storage (lost on page refresh)

**Implementation approach**:

- Set cookie in login response with proper flags
- Automatic cookie reading in middleware
- Clear cookie on logout

### Password Hashing and User Management

**Decision**: Use bcrypt for password hashing with cost factor 12  
**Rationale**:

- Industry standard for password hashing
- Built-in salt generation
- Adjustable cost factor for future-proofing
- Available in Go standard library (golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)

**Alternatives considered**:

- scrypt (more complex configuration)
- argon2 (newer but less adopted)
- Plain SHA256 (not secure enough)

**Implementation approach**:

- Hash password on user creation/update
- Compare hashed password during authentication
- Store only hashed passwords in database

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Design

**Decision**: Simple role-based system with predefined roles and middleware enforcement  
**Rationale**:

- Matches the specification requirements
- Easy to understand and implement
- Sufficient for current scope (admin vs regular user)
- Can be extended later if needed

**Alternatives considered**:

- Permission-based system (too complex for current needs)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) (overkill)
- No authorization (security risk)

**Implementation approach**:

- Define roles as constants (admin, user)
- Store roles in JWT claims as string array
- Create middleware to check roles per endpoint
- Database table for user-role relationships

### Frontend Authentication State Management

**Decision**: React Context API with custom hooks for authentication state  
**Rationale**:

- Built into React, no additional dependencies
- Centralized state management for auth
- Easy to consume throughout component tree
- Integrates well with protected routes

**Alternatives considered**:

- Redux (too complex for auth-only state)
- Zustand (additional dependency)
- Local component state (would cause prop drilling)

**Implementation approach**:

- AuthProvider context component
- useAuth custom hook for consuming auth state
- Automatic token refresh logic
- Protected route wrapper components

### Database Schema Extensions

**Decision**: Extend existing user table and add roles/user_roles tables  
**Rationale**:

- Leverages existing user management infrastructure
- Follows normalized database design
- Supports many-to-many user-role relationships
- Compatible with current GORM setup

**Alternatives considered**:

- Store roles as JSON in user table (less flexible)
- Single role per user (too restrictive)
- Complete rewrite of user system (unnecessary)

**Implementation approach**:

- Use GORM AutoMigrate to extend User struct with password_hash and is_active fields
- Create Role and UserRole structs for GORM to auto-create tables
- No manual SQL migrations needed - GORM handles schema automatically
- GORM associations for easy querying
- Role seeding on application startup using FirstOrCreate

## Security Considerations

### Token Security

- Use strong secret key (32+ characters, from environment)
- Short token expiration (1-4 hours recommended)
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Log all authentication events for auditing

### Cookie Security

- httpOnly flag prevents XSS
- secure flag for HTTPS-only transmission
- sameSite=strict prevents CSRF
- Clear cookies on logout

### Password Security

- bcrypt with cost factor 12
- Minimum password requirements (8+ chars, complexity)
- Account lockout after failed attempts (future enhancement)
- Password reset functionality (future enhancement)

### API Security

- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- HTTPS required in production
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via GORM

## Performance Considerations

### JWT Validation Performance

- Stateless tokens eliminate database lookups per request
- In-memory signature validation is fast (<1ms)
- Cache JWT parsing results if needed
- Use middleware early in request pipeline

### Database Performance

- Index on username for login queries
- Efficient user-role lookup queries
- Connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Consider caching role data for high-traffic scenarios

### Frontend Performance

- Minimize re-renders with React.memo
- Lazy load admin components
- Efficient form validation
- Optimistic UI updates where safe

## Integration Points

### Existing Codebase Integration

- Extend existing internal/api/auth.go
- Reuse existing user domain models
- Integrate with current middleware patterns
- Leverage existing database connection setup

### Monitoring and Logging

- Use existing audit log system for auth events
- Add metrics for login success/failure rates
- Monitor JWT token validation performance
- Track admin operations for compliance

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Database schema updates** - Use GORM AutoMigrate for User, Role, and UserRole models
2. **JWT service implementation** - Token generation and validation
3. **Authentication middleware** - Automatic token checking
4. **API endpoints** - Login, logout, user management
5. **Frontend components** - Login form, protected routes, admin interface
6. **Testing** - Unit tests for services, integration tests for flows
7. **Security review** - Validate implementation against OWASP guidelines
