# Feature Specification: JWT Authentication and Authorization System

**Feature Branch**: `001-jwt-auth-system`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Make the site present a login page that requires a user to log in. Use token-based authentication and authorization with JWT tokens. Store the token in a browser cookie named auth. Use the roles claim to determine what roles the user is in. Provide a user admin page that allows users to be created and assigned to roles."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - User Login Authentication (Priority: P1)

A user visits the site and must log in with their credentials to access any protected content. Upon successful authentication, they receive a JWT token stored in a browser cookie that grants access to the system.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the security system - without authentication, no other features can function properly. It's the minimal viable security implementation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user account, attempting to access the site, being redirected to login, successfully logging in, and gaining access to at least one protected page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unauthenticated user visits the site, **When** they try to access any page, **Then** they are redirected to the login page
2. **Given** a user is on the login page, **When** they enter valid credentials and submit, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the main application with a JWT token stored in the "auth" cookie
3. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the login page
4. **Given** an authenticated user with a valid JWT token, **When** they navigate to any page, **Then** they can access the content without being redirected to login

### User Story 2 - Role-Based Access Control (Priority: P2)

The system uses JWT token claims to determine user roles and restricts access to features based on those roles. Different users see different functionality based on their assigned roles.

**Why this priority**: Once basic authentication works, role-based authorization is critical for controlling what users can do. This enables proper security boundaries.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating users with different roles, logging in as each user, and verifying they can only access features appropriate to their role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with "admin" role is authenticated, **When** they navigate through the application, **Then** they can access all features including user management
2. **Given** a user with "user" role is authenticated, **When** they try to access admin features, **Then** they are denied access with an appropriate error message
3. **Given** a user's JWT token contains role claims, **When** the system processes requests, **Then** it correctly identifies and enforces the user's role permissions
4. **Given** a user's session expires or JWT token becomes invalid, **When** they try to access any protected resource, **Then** they are redirected to login

---

### User Story 3 - User Administration Interface (Priority: P3)

Administrators can access a dedicated user management page where they can create new user accounts, view existing users, and assign or modify user roles.

**Why this priority**: While important for system administration, this feature depends on the authentication and authorization system being functional first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as an admin user, accessing the user admin page, creating a new user, assigning roles, and verifying the new user can log in with appropriate permissions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin user is authenticated, **When** they navigate to the user admin page, **Then** they see a list of all existing users and their roles
2. **Given** an admin is on the user admin page, **When** they create a new user with specific roles, **Then** the user is created and can log in with those role permissions
3. **Given** an admin selects an existing user, **When** they modify the user's roles and save, **Then** the user's permissions are updated immediately
4. **Given** a non-admin user tries to access the user admin page, **When** they navigate to that URL, **Then** they are denied access with an appropriate error message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a JWT token expires while a user is actively using the system?
- How does the system handle malformed or tampered JWT tokens?
- What occurs when a user's roles are changed while they have an active session?
- How does the system respond when the cookie storage fails or is disabled?
- What happens when the same user logs in from multiple devices simultaneously?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST present a login page to all unauthenticated users attempting to access any protected content
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users using username/password credentials and generate JWT tokens upon successful authentication
- **FR-003**: System MUST store JWT tokens in a browser cookie named "auth" with appropriate security flags
- **FR-004**: System MUST include role information in JWT token claims to support role-based authorization
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate JWT tokens on every request to protected resources and extract role information
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide role-based access control, restricting features based on user roles defined in JWT claims
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a user administration interface accessible only to users with admin role
- **FR-008**: User admin interface MUST allow creation of new user accounts with username, password, and role assignment
- **FR-009**: User admin interface MUST display all existing users and their assigned roles
- **FR-010**: User admin interface MUST allow modification of user roles for existing accounts
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle JWT token expiration gracefully by redirecting users to login page
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate JWT token integrity and reject invalid or tampered tokens
- **FR-013**: System MUST log authentication and authorization events for security auditing

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a system user with attributes including unique identifier, username, password (hashed), and creation timestamp
- **Role**: Represents a permission level or access group that can be assigned to users (e.g., "admin", "user", "viewer")
- **JWT Token**: Contains user identity, role claims, expiration time, and other security metadata for stateless authentication
- **Authentication Session**: Tracks user login state through JWT token stored in browser cookie

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete the login process in under 30 seconds from entering credentials to accessing protected content
- **SC-002**: System correctly enforces role-based access control with 100% accuracy - users can only access features appropriate to their assigned roles
- **SC-003**: JWT tokens are validated on every request with response times under 100ms to maintain application performance
- **SC-004**: Admin users can create new users and assign roles through the admin interface in under 2 minutes per user
- **SC-005**: System handles JWT token expiration gracefully with automatic redirect to login page within 5 seconds of detection
- **SC-006**: Authentication system supports at least 100 concurrent users without performance degradation
- **SC-007**: All authentication and authorization events are logged with 100% coverage for security audit trails
