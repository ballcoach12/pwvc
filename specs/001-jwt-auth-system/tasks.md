## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundation) → Phase 3 (US1) → Phase 4 (US2) → Phase 5 (US3) → Phase 6 (Polish)
```

**Critical Path**: US1 must complete before US2 (authentication before authorization), US2 must complete before US3 (authorization before admin features).

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1 Setup**: T001-T011 can run in parallel (backend deps, frontend deps, GORM model definitions)

**Phase 2 Foundation**: T012-T021 are parallelizable (services, middleware, frontend core)

**Phase 3 US1**: T026-T028 (frontend components) can be developed in parallel with T022-T025 (backend handlers)

**Phase 4 US2**: T034-T035, T040-T041 (user management and frontend role handling) can be parallelized

**Phase 5 US3**: T046-T050 (admin API endpoints) and T052-T055 (admin components) are highly parallelizable

**Phase 6 Polish**: T064-T075 can all be developed in parallel as they are independent enhancements

### MVP Delivery Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1-3 (US1 only) for basic authentication

- Delivers: User login, JWT authentication, protected routes, cookie storage
- Independent test: Users can log in and access protected content
- Estimated completion: ~12-15 tasks

**Incremental Delivery**:

1. **MVP**: US1 (Basic Authentication) - Phases 1-3
2. **Version 1.1**: + US2 (Role-Based Access) - Phase 4
3. **Version 1.2**: + US3 (Admin Interface) - Phase 5
4. **Version 1.3**: + Polish & Enhancements - Phase 6

### Independent Testing Criteria

**US1 Test**: Create test user → visit protected page → redirect to login → enter credentials → successful login → access granted
**US2 Test**: Create admin and regular users → login as each → verify admin can access admin features, regular user cannot
**US3 Test**: Login as admin → access admin page → create new user with roles → new user can login with correct permissions
