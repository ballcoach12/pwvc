# Prompt 2: Feature Management System

Implement feature CRUD operations with description and acceptance criteria fields. Add CSV import functionality for bulk feature creation. Create REST endpoints for feature management within projects.

## Requirements
- Create `features` database table with proper schema
- Implement feature CRUD operations within projects
- Add CSV import/export functionality for bulk feature management
- Create feature validation logic
- Add endpoints for feature management
- Include proper error handling for invalid data

## Database Schema
```sql
-- features table
CREATE TABLE features (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INTEGER REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    acceptance_criteria TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## API Endpoints to Create
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/features` - Create new feature
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/features` - List all features in project
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/features/{feature_id}` - Get specific feature
- `PUT /api/projects/{id}/features/{feature_id}` - Update feature
- `DELETE /api/projects/{id}/features/{feature_id}` - Delete feature
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/features/import` - Import features from CSV
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/features/export` - Export features to CSV

## CSV Format
```csv
title,description,acceptance_criteria
"User Login","Users can authenticate with email/password","Given valid credentials, user should be logged in successfully"
"Dashboard View","Display key metrics and navigation","Dashboard loads within 2 seconds and shows current data"
```

## Validation Rules
- Title: Required, max 255 characters
- Description: Required, max 5000 characters  
- Acceptance Criteria: Optional, max 5000 characters
