## Frontend Principles (React)

### Component-First Architecture
All UI and feature work MUST start with a clear, testable component contract.
Components MUST be small, focused, and reusable. Each component MUST have
explicit inputs (props) and outputs (events/callbacks) and be independently
testable in isolation (unit tests + storybook or equivalent). Composition of
components MUST prefer composition over inheritance.

Rationale: A component-first approach enforces encapsulation, simplifies
reasoning about UI, and enables incremental delivery and reuse across the app.

### Test-First (TDD) & Maintainable Tests
Tests MUST be authored before or at the same time as implementation for all
new features and components that affect behavior. Unit tests for components
MUST cover props and critical UI states. Integration tests (user flows) MUST
exist for primary user journeys. Tests MUST be deterministic and runnable in
CI.

Rationale: Writing tests early reduces regressions, documents expected
behavior, and makes refactors safe. Tests are part of the shipped artifact.

### Accessibility & Inclusive Design
Accessibility (a11y) MUST be treated as a first-class requirement. All
interactive UI components MUST meet WCAG AA semantics where applicable: proper
role/aria attributes, keyboard navigation, and visible focus states. Accessibility
checks MUST be included in the CI pipeline (automated audits) and verified by
manual spot-checks for critical screens.

Rationale: Accessible interfaces increase product reach and reduce legal and
usability risk. Making a11y non-negotiable avoids late-stage rework.

### Performance, Simplicity & Small Components
Code and UI decisions MUST favor simplicity and measurable performance. React
components MUST avoid unnecessary re-renders (use memoization where appropriate)
and prefer lightweight data flows. Large components MUST be split when a clear
separation of concerns exists. Performance budgets (e.g., Time To Interactive,
bundle size) SHOULD be established per project and enforced in CI where possible.

Rationale: Simple designs are easier to maintain and optimize; enforcing
component granularity prevents monolithic UI code and reduces cognitive load.

### Observability, Error Handling & Versioning
Applications MUST include structured logging for runtime errors, client-side
metrics for usage/performance, and clear error-handling paths for recoverable
failures. Release versioning MUST follow semantic versioning for public APIs
(e.g., component libraries) and a documented changelog MUST be maintained.

Rationale: Observability enables faster diagnosis in production. Semantic
versioning communicates breaking changes clearly to downstream consumers.

## Backend Principles (Go)

### Service-First Architecture & Clean Dependencies
All backend functionality MUST be organized into focused services with clear
boundaries. Services MUST follow dependency inversion (depend on interfaces,
not concrete implementations). Each service MUST have a single responsibility
and be independently testable through interface mocking. Database and external
dependencies MUST be abstracted behind repository/client interfaces.

Rationale: Service-oriented architecture with dependency inversion enables
easier testing, reduces coupling, and supports incremental refactoring.

### Idiomatic Go & Standard Library First
Code MUST follow Go conventions: short variable names in limited scope, package
names that are lowercase and descriptive, error handling with explicit checks
(no panic in business logic). Standard library MUST be preferred over third-party
dependencies unless substantial value is added. Dependencies MUST be justified
and minimally scoped.

Rationale: Idiomatic Go code is more maintainable by the broader Go community.
Minimizing dependencies reduces attack surface and build complexity.

### Context-Aware Operations & Graceful Degradation
All operations that involve I/O (database, HTTP, file system) MUST accept and
honor context.Context for cancellation and timeouts. Services MUST implement
graceful shutdown procedures. HTTP endpoints MUST have appropriate timeouts
and handle client disconnections gracefully.

Rationale: Context-aware operations prevent resource leaks and enable
predictable behavior under load. Graceful degradation improves user experience.

### Contract-First API Design & Validation
All HTTP APIs MUST be designed contract-first with OpenAPI specifications or
equivalent. Input validation MUST happen at API boundaries with clear error
messages. APIs MUST use standard HTTP status codes and consistent JSON error
formats. Version compatibility MUST be maintained for public APIs.

Rationale: Contract-first design enables frontend/backend parallel development
and reduces integration issues. Proper validation prevents data corruption.

### Comprehensive Error Handling & Observability
Errors MUST be wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf or equivalent. Structured
logging MUST be used for all significant operations with consistent log levels.
Metrics MUST be exposed (Prometheus format preferred) for key business and
system operations. Distributed tracing SHOULD be implemented for complex
request flows.

Rationale: Comprehensive error handling and observability are essential for
production systems and enable rapid issue diagnosis.

## Additional Constraints

### Frontend (React)
- Technology stack MUST be React (v16.8+ or newer) with functional components
	and hooks. TypeScript is RECOMMENDED for new code.
- Linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier) MUST be configured and run in CI.
- CI pipeline MUST run lint, type-check (if TypeScript), tests, and a11y checks
	for all pull requests targeting main branches.

### Backend (Go)
- Go version MUST be 1.21 or newer for new projects. Version pinning MUST be
	explicit in go.mod files.
- Code formatting MUST use `gofmt` and linting MUST use `golangci-lint` with
	a project-specific configuration.
- CI pipeline MUST run `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, and all tests
	(unit + integration) for backend changes.
- Database migrations MUST be versioned and reversible where possible.

### Cross-Cutting
- All services MUST implement health check endpoints for monitoring.
- Environment-specific configuration MUST be externalized (environment
	variables, config files) and never hardcoded.
- Secrets MUST never be committed to version control and MUST use secure
	secret management systems in production.

Rationale: These constraints create a predictable development environment,
ensure code quality, and prevent common security and operational issues.

## Development Workflow

- Branching: Feature branches (feature/*) for work; PRs for all merges into main
	or release branches.
- Code review: Every PR MUST have at least one approving reviewer besides the
	author and pass the CI checks before merge.
- QA & Releases: Releases MUST include a changelog entry and version bump per
	the governance policy. Deploys to production MUST be accompanied by a
	smoke-test plan.

Rationale: A lightweight but enforced workflow reduces mistakes and ensures
traceability from feature -> tests -> release.

## Governance

Amendments: Changes to this constitution MUST be proposed as a documented
pull request that updates this file. A constitutional amendment PR MUST include
the rationale and migration steps (if required). Approval requires at least one
project maintainer and one independent reviewer (or a majority of the active
maintainers when a maintainer list exists). Major governance changes SHOULD be
announced to the team and scheduled with a migration plan.

Versioning policy: The constitution uses semantic versioning for its own
edits:

- MAJOR: Backward-incompatible governance or principle removal/renaming.
- MINOR: Addition of a new principle or material expansion of guidance.
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, or non-semantic refinements.

Compliance reviews: All new plans and specs generated by `.specify/*` commands
MUST include a quick "Constitution Check" that lists how the plan satisfies the
core principles. Non-compliant items MUST be documented with justification in
the plan's Complexity Tracking table.
